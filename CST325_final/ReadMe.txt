What was your favorite topic or project in the course and why? (1pt)

I think I enjoyed the raytracing the most in this course.  I like the fact that we're exploring where the field
is going in the future, and I think the logic behind it is most intuitive.  While the rendering pipeline may be
more what those of us going into graphics quickly might use, it feels more complicated that raytracing.


If you could improve any aspect of this course, what would it be and why? (1pt)

There's a lot of information in this course, and I'm not sure that I fully digested all of it.  I think that
part of this is just due to the program setup, 8 weeks per class, but I also think it's just a lot of material.
I feel like I have good, high level understanding of what goes into the process, which is something that, at
least in my opinion, is more valuable than knowing the intricacies at this level, but if there was a way to get
those that ARE more interested more into the nitty-gritty, that would be nice.  I enjoyed this class quite a bit,
and maybe that's the point of the extra credit options, giving those that want to the option to really dig in.
